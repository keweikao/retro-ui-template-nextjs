# Research: Google AI Image Generation with RetroUI

## RetroUI Design System Analysis

**Decision**: Use existing RetroUI components with consistent design patterns
**Rationale**:
- RetroUI uses distinctive retro/brutalist design with yellow primary color (#ffdb33)
- Black borders (2px) and shadows with hover animations (translate-y-1)
- Button variants: default (yellow), secondary (black), outline, link
- Typography uses Geist Sans font family
- Follows shadcn/ui component patterns with class-variance-authority

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom components - Rejected to maintain design consistency
- Plain Tailwind styling - Rejected as RetroUI components already exist

## Google AI SDK Integration

**Decision**: Use `@ai-sdk/google` with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview
**Rationale**:
- Official Vercel AI SDK provider for Google models
- Supports Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview specifically for image generation
- Consistent with existing AI SDK architecture in project
- Built-in TypeScript support and error handling

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct Google AI API calls - Rejected due to complexity and lack of consistency
- OpenAI DALL-E integration - Rejected as user specifically requested Google

## Image Generation Architecture

**Decision**: Next.js API route with streaming/polling for image generation
**Rationale**:
- `/app/api/generate-image/route.ts` for server-side Google AI calls
- Image generation is typically slower than text, may need polling approach
- Secure API key handling on server side
- Compatible with existing Next.js App Router architecture

**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side calls - Rejected due to API key security concerns
- Server Actions - Evaluated but API routes provide better error handling control

## UI Component Design Pattern

**Decision**: Custom ImageGenerator component using RetroUI Button and Input patterns
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with RetroUI aesthetic (shadows, borders, yellow accents)
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
- Loading states using RetroUI button disabled styles
- Error handling with consistent visual feedback

**Alternatives considered**:
- Form-based approach - Considered but simple input/button is more intuitive
- Modal-based generation - Rejected as user wants homepage integration

## Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with RetroUI breakpoints
**Rationale**:
- Tailwind CSS breakpoint system (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
- Stack layout on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Image scaling to container width with aspect ratio preservation
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile devices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Desktop-first approach - Rejected as mobile-first is modern standard
- Fixed layout - Rejected due to user requirement for responsive design

## API Key Management

**Decision**: Environment variable with `.env.local` configuration
**Rationale**:
- Secure server-side API key storage
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Never exposed to client-side code
- Follows Next.js security best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side API key - Rejected due to security risks
- Database storage - Rejected as overkill for single API key

## Image Display and Optimization

**Decision**: Next.js Image component with proper optimization
**Rationale**:
- Automatic image optimization and lazy loading
- Proper aspect ratio handling and responsive srcsets
- Better performance and Core Web Vitals scores
- Consistent with Next.js best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Raw img tags - Rejected due to lack of optimization
- Custom image handling - Rejected as Next.js Image is superior

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Graceful error handling with RetroUI visual feedback
**Rationale**:
- API errors displayed in consistent UI components
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- User-friendly error messages (not technical details)
- Retry functionality for failed generations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Console-only errors - Rejected due to poor UX
- Modal error dialogs - Considered but inline feedback is less disruptive

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Client-side loading states with optimistic UI updates
**Rationale**:
- Immediate visual feedback when generation starts
- Progress indication during longer image generation times
- Image preloading and caching for generated results
- Debounced input to prevent excessive API calls

**Alternatives considered**:
- Synchronous generation - Rejected due to poor UX during long waits
- Background processing - Considered but real-time feedback is preferred
