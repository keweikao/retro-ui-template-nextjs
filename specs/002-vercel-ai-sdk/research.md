# Research: Vercel AI SDK Integration

## AI SDK Core Package Selection

**Decision**: Use `ai` as the core package with modular providers
**Rationale**:
- Official Vercel AI SDK with comprehensive TypeScript support
- Unified API across multiple AI providers
- Built-in streaming support for real-time responses
- React hooks (`useChat`, `useCompletion`) for UI integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic) - Rejected due to lack of unified interface
- LangChain - Too heavy for this integration scope

## AI Provider Selection

**Decision**: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers initially
**Rationale**:
- OpenAI (`@ai-sdk/openai`): Most mature, GPT-4 models
- Anthropic (`@ai-sdk/anthropic`): Claude models for alternative responses
- Google (`@ai-sdk/google`): Gemini models for cost-effective options
- Provider-specific packages ensure proper authentication and model access

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single provider only - Rejected to provide user choice and fallback options
- Community providers - Deferred until core providers working

## React Integration Pattern

**Decision**: Use `@ai-sdk/react` hooks with Next.js App Router
**Rationale**:
- `useChat` hook handles message state, streaming, and UI updates
- Compatible with Next.js client components
- Built-in error handling and loading states
- Follows React best practices with proper state management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom state management - Rejected due to complexity
- Server Components only - Rejected due to need for real-time interaction

## API Architecture

**Decision**: Next.js API routes with streaming responses
**Rationale**:
- `/app/api/chat/route.ts` pattern follows Next.js conventions
- `streamText()` function provides real-time responses
- Edge runtime compatible for better performance
- Built-in CORS and security handling

**Alternatives considered**:
- External API service - Rejected to maintain single codebase
- Server Actions - Rejected as not suitable for streaming responses

## Environment Configuration

**Decision**: `.env.local` with provider-specific API keys
**Rationale**:
- Secure API key storage following Next.js conventions
- Separate keys for each provider (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, etc.)
- Local development and production deployment support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single API key - Rejected as each provider requires separate authentication
- Runtime configuration - Rejected due to security concerns

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library for components, integration tests for API routes
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with existing Next.js testing ecosystem
- Component testing for chat UI interactions
- API route testing with mocked AI provider responses
- Integration testing for complete chat flow

**Alternatives considered**:
- E2E only - Rejected due to AI API costs during testing
- Unit tests only - Rejected as integration testing needed for streaming

## Type Safety

**Decision**: Full TypeScript integration with Zod for validation
**Rationale**:
- Zod schemas for API request/response validation
- TypeScript interfaces for chat messages and AI responses
- Type-safe provider configurations
- Runtime validation for user inputs

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript only - Rejected due to project TypeScript requirement
- Manual typing - Rejected due to error-prone nature

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Streaming responses with client-side state management
**Rationale**:
- Real-time user feedback with progressive response display
- Client-side message history for quick navigation
- Efficient memory usage with message batching
- Edge runtime for reduced latency

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full page responses - Rejected due to poor UX
- Server-side state - Rejected due to scalability concerns
