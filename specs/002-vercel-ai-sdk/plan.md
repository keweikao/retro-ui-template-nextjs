# Implementation Plan: Vercel AI SDK Integration

**Branch**: `002-vercel-ai-sdk` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/stephen/Desktop/retro-ui-template-nextjs/specs/002-vercel-ai-sdk/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → Verify PNPM usage requirement (Principle I)
   → Confirm CLI script availability (Principle II)
   → Check Next.js framework adherence (Principle III)
   → Validate modern JavaScript standards (Principle IV)
   → Ensure component-driven UI approach (Principle V)
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Integrate Vercel AI SDK into existing Next.js project to enable AI-powered features including chat interfaces, text generation, and streaming AI responses from multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). Implementation must use pnpm exclusively and follow existing Next.js App Router architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with ES2022 features
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18+, Next.js 14+ (App Router), Vercel AI SDK, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: N/A (chat state managed in-memory/client-side)
**Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for components, integration testing for API routes
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), Node.js runtime, Vercel deployment
**Project Type**: Single Next.js web application (App Router)
**Performance Goals**: <200ms API response time, real-time streaming, 60fps UI interactions
**Constraints**: API rate limits from AI providers, streaming response handling, error recovery
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer integration, basic chat interface, multiple AI provider support

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: PNPM-Exclusive CLI Operations ✅ PASS
- All package installations will use `pnpm add` exclusively
- AI SDK packages: `pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/google zod`
- Development scripts will use `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`

### Principle II: CLI-First Development ✅ PASS
- All development tasks accessible via package.json scripts
- Testing, building, and development operations will be scriptable
- Integration with existing `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build` workflow

### Principle III: Next.js Framework Adherence ✅ PASS
- Uses Next.js App Router architecture
- API routes follow `/app/api/` convention
- Client components follow Next.js patterns with 'use client' directive
- TypeScript integration maintained

### Principle IV: Modern JavaScript Standards ✅ PASS
- TypeScript throughout with proper type definitions
- ES modules and async/await for AI API calls
- Modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)

### Principle V: Component-Driven UI Development ✅ PASS
- Chat components will be modular and reusable
- TypeScript interfaces for proper typing
- Single responsibility principle for UI components
- Compatible with existing Tailwind CSS styling

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Next.js App Router with API routes

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Chat API contract → API route test and implementation tasks
- ChatMessage entity → TypeScript interfaces and validation
- AI Provider configuration → environment setup and provider integration
- React chat interface → component creation and hook integration

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Setup: Package installation, environment configuration
- TDD order: API tests before implementation, component tests before UI
- Dependencies: Types/interfaces → API routes → React components
- Mark [P] for parallel execution: Different files can be worked simultaneously

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: pnpm package installation, .env.local configuration
2. **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for messages, providers, responses
3. **API Implementation**: /app/api/chat/route.ts with streaming support
4. **React Components**: Chat interface with useChat hook integration
5. **Testing**: API route tests, component tests, integration scenarios
6. **Validation**: Build checks, type checking, quickstart scenario validation

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
